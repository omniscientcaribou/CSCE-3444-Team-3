# CSCE-3444-Team-3

This is CSCE 3444 Section 001 Team # 3's repository for our group project (Spring 2021).  

This is the readme for the customer interface.  

Employee's will log in at each table when setting up the restaurant for the day.  
when they log in to the customer UI they will select the table that corresponds to the table number they are logging in to.  
This will redirect the page to the page that will be presented to customers.  
When a customer sits down they will click on menu. This tags the table as occupied.  
they will place an order and can do all the functionality described in the srs and test cases.
