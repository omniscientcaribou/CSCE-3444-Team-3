# CSCE-3444-Team-3

This is CSCE 3444 Section 001 Team # 3's repository for our group project (Spring 2021).

This is the readme for the virtualhost UI  
The virtual host pings the database every 20 seconds  
if a table is occupied the color is changed to maroon and it is labeled as occupied signifying that customers can't sit there  
if a table is not occupied the color is set to blue and it just has a table number signifying a customer can sit there  
if all of the tables are full an approximate wait timer is displayed
