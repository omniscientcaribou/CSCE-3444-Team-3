# CSCE-3444-Team-3

This is CSCE 3444 Section 001 Team # 3's repository for our group project (Spring 2021).

Team 3 decided our implementation would best be suited as a micro web service. Please,
see each of the following branches for the final version of our implementations (this is why
our main only has a README).

At a high level our front end interfaces utilize both React as well as standard HTML/Javascript. 
Our database/API uses Django (Python). All of our web services are hosted on the Heroku platform
and are accessible from anywhere on any device that has access to the internet.

Please use the following Test Cases when grading our project: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nk-5owrSoLhzDF357b840uTbTVE53eLNmh2kcC_uaoE/edit#gid=1879101890

Please, note, that our repository does have a lot of branches. In practice, we would have
squashed and merged these branches into main. But in the interest of preserving history
and showing our work as we progressed we decided to keep them.
